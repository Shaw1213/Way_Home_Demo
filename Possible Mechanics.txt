Inventory System (Possible)
Basic movement
Ghost Levels (Maybe use a multiplier/formula to calculate changes)
Interactable Objects (for puzzles and stuff)
//Dialogue boxes/display (maybe no dialogue)
Doors/Gates
Movable objects (storage boxes, chairs ect) (Account for different weights)
Adjustable player transparency
Possibly a Quest system
One hit death with immediate respawn, number of hits taken goes up with ghost level (So a basic health system lmao)
